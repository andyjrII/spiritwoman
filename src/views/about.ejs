      <p>
        The vision for "The Spiritual Woman Fellowship" resonates with many
        women who love God and desire to live a FULL life. We yearn to
        fellowship with women who can truly make things happen through prayer.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are learning that there's a spiritual dimension we can tap into if we
        connect with our spirituality. Weâ€™ve come to understand that we are not
        just natural beings but supernatural, created in the likeness of God.
